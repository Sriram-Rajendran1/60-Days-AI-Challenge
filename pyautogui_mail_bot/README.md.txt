# PyAutoGUI Gmail Automation Bot

This Python script uses **PyAutoGUI** to automate opening Gmail in a web browser, logging into the account, and typing messages automatically.  
It simulates real keyboard and mouse actions, so it moves and types just like a human would.

---

## 🛠 Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed, then install PyAutoGUI:

```bash
pip install pyautogui


Important Notes

This script controls your mouse & keyboard.
Do not touch your mouse or keyboard while it's running. 

The script uses hardcoded screen coordinates (x, y).
These coordinates may not match your screen.
You will need to adjust them based on your display.
